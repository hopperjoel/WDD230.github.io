      The Amazon layout for their mobile app includes some interesting features. They attempt to reduce the amount of choices and confine them to a single page.
      This includes the "Ship to" link, the "Quantity" box, and the "Buy Now" button that can make it easier to accurately place the order while reducing choices
      to a little as they reasonably can.

          The Lego Mobile site provides a very noticeable visual hierarchy on the main page with a big featured lego set or group of sets immediately followed
          by smaller icons. The top logo and navigation box are also smaller, which draws even more attention to the featured set.

            <img src="
        <p class = "rule-paragraph">
          The Amazon layout for their mobile app includes some interesting features. They attempt to reduce the amount of choices and confine them to a single page.
          This includes the "Ship to" link, the "Quantity" box, and the "Buy Now" button that can make it easier to accurately place the order while reducing choices
          to a little as they reasonably can.

            <img src="
        <p class = "rule-paragraph">
          The square mobile (and desktop) site are consistent with the product design, both of which demonstrate a favorable amount of whitespace and "cleanliness."
          The content sections are well spaced and the white background highlights the images and content very well. It would also serve as a good example of other 
          principles of design including contrast and repetition.

                    because it's more specific to the area and a little easier to use than the news website. He checks the "Preston"
                    page to check on weather updates. He also checks the information from the prior year to get a better idea
                    for weather predictions.

                    look at the featured stories. She picks one that she likes to discuss with the class. She then navigates
                    to the "Storm Center" page to look more specific information as part of a homework assignment for her class.

                    all of the mountain west. They cursorily examine the home page to look at any potential local events before quickly glancing
                    at the "Storm Center" page to look for any inclement weather.
